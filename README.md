# Terror In Carcosa

Terror In Carcosa is an RPG project developed to offer an immersive gaming experience with combat, events, and character creation. The system allows players to create and manage characters of different classes and races, engage in battles and random events, and experience a dynamic and engaging game environment with a cosmic horror theme, primarily inspired by *"The King in Yellow."*

## Features

The project includes the following features:

- **Character Creation**: Allows players to create characters from various classes, including Warrior, Mage, Rogue, and Healer, as well as choose a race. Each class and race comes with unique characteristics and abilities.
- **Combat System**: Implements battles between the player's character and enemies, offering options for normal and special attacks, escaping, using items, and more.
- **Non-Combat Events**: Includes random events that can affect the character's state, such as finding healing potions or rare items.
- **Mana and Experience Management**: Characters can use mana for special abilities and gain experience to level up and improve their stats.
- **Classes**: Each class is unique with its own mechanics, description, and lore.
- **Races**: Each race provides initial bonuses and comes with its own description.
- **Player Interaction**: Many events require player decisions, along with other aspects such as character movement and item management.

## Technologies Used

The project was developed using the following technologies:

- **Java**: Main programming language used to implement game logic.
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: To structure and organize the game's code.
- **IntelliJ (IDE)**: The IDE used to develop the project.
- **SOLID Principles**: The project was developed following the SOLID principles.
- **JLine**: Library for Java key mapping and input reading.

## Key Learnings

The main learnings from this project include:

- **RPG System Development**: Building a complete RPG system with character creation, combat, and events.
- **State and Resource Management**: Managing character attributes such as health, attack, mana, and experience.
- **Random Event Implementation**: Creating and integrating events that dynamically affect the player's experience.
- **Code Organization**: The main challenge was organizing the code to adhere to SOLID principles and meet industry standards.
- **Refactoring**: As the project grew in scope and complexity, refactoring became necessary to maintain code quality.

## Conclusion

Terror In Carcosa is an RPG game that demonstrates fundamental software development concepts, including building a combat system, managing resources, and implementing random events. This project provided valuable opportunities to learn and apply modern development practices while creating an engaging and interactive gaming experience.
